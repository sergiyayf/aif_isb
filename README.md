# An emergent inflation-selection balance governs the evolutionary

This repository contains code to analyze experimental and simulation data of evolutionary rescue
in dense populations. 

## Figures 
Figure in this manuscript were produced using the corresponding python scripts Figure_X/Figure_x_y.py

### Figure 1
Synthetic mutation assay to study evolutionary rescue dynamics in expanding microbial colonies.

### Figure 2
Slower-growing resistant mutants are stabilized at a quasi-constant equilibrium width, reshaping
the acquisition and effect of compensatory mutations.

### Figure 3
The impact of compensatory mutations on
treatment failure is delayed.

### Figure 4
The opposing effects of peripheral inflation
and width-dependent selection create a quasistable
equilibrium width.

### Figure 5
Including inflation-selection balance in a random walk model of range expansion reproduces experimental
observations.

### Figure 6
The interplay of inflation-selection balance and evolutionary rescue inherently emerges in an agentbased
in silico tumor model.

## Data
Random walk model data files are too large for the repository due to very large number of clones (same file also contains all of the controls presented in the SI), and can be provided by the authors upon request.
